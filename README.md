# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where some Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied to elements. The issue appears to be intermittent, and may be tied to class ordering or conflicts.  The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` offers a potential solution.

## Bug Description

Certain Tailwind classes, such as `max-w-7xl`, `mx-auto`, and `px-4`, are failing to apply correctly in some instances, resulting in unexpected styling inconsistencies.  The bug's behavior is not entirely consistent, making it difficult to pinpoint a definitive cause.

## Solution

The solution involves restructuring the class application, ensuring the utility classes do not conflict and the order adheres to best practice.  This may involve using the `@apply` directive more judiciously, or using a more specific selector for the targeted element.
